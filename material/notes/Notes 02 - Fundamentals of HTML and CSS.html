# Notes - Fundamentals of HTML and CSS 

Supplementary notes to complement the lecture material for web programming (F28WP).

## HyperText Markup Language


HyperText Markup Language
HTML pages reflow in width and length to fit the screen breadth.
Major versions of HyperText Mar kup Language include:
- HTML 3.2 W3C standard Januar y 1997
- HTML 4.01 W3C standard December 1999 revising 4.0 from 1997
- XHTML 1.0 W3C standard Januar y 2000, revised August 2002
- HTML 5 W3C standard October 2014

HTML 2 supports entities, for ms, headings, hyper links, images, lists.
It was internationalised with charset and lang attr ibutes in 1997.
HTML 3.2 added applets, super/subscr ipts, tables. JEditor uses it.
HTML 4.01
- added frames, (embedded) objects, scr ipts, style sheets
- has 3 versions - frameset, transitional and str ict
XHTML 1.0 refor mulates HTML 4 as XML 1.0 application that was
- intended as stepping stone in migration from HTML to XML
- both HTML 4.01 and XML at same time

XHTML 1.1 modularised XHTML 1.0 and is used in ePub 2 e-books.
HTML 5.2 is current version of HTML standardised in December 2017.

All HTML versions require following pattern (after DOCTYPE)

```xml
<html>
	<head> <title> ... </title> ... </head>
	<body>
	...
	</body>
</html>
```




# HTML Basics
HTML documents consist of text mixed with
- declaration HTML version and its DTD (versions after 3.2)
- elements markup directives inside "<" and ">"
- entity references codes between ampersand and semicolon

HTML 5+ declaration is
```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

HTML 4.01 Strict declaration is
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
"https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
```

Most tags appear in complementary pairs like `<ol> ... </ol>`

Solo tags appear in HTML as `<br>` or in XHTML or XML as `<br/>`.

Tags can have attributes associating name with string value:
```
<img src="me.gif" alt="picture of wonderful me">
```

Entities represent special characters and glyphs
- can either be a character or numer ical entity reference
- start with "&" and end with ";"
HTML character entities denote common and maths symbols:

- `& lt;` < less than
- `& amp;` & ampersand
- `& omega;` ω Greek omega

Numerical names for entities reference Unicode characters

- `&#D;` decimal digits D like `& #937;` for omega (&#937;)
- `&#xH;` hexadecimal digits H like `& #x6CF0` for Chinese tai (&#x6CF0)


# HTML Validation
HTML validation can be done via http://validator.w3.org/
HTML to validate can be specified by
- URL
- uploading HTML file from local file system
- pasting HTML to validate into a window


Validation link can be added to any HTML page with
<a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer">Valid HTML?</a>

Clicking on link asks W3C validator to validate invoking page.


# Text and Hypertext

When rendering text in HTML, the HTML processor normally
- collapses inter-word whitespaces to single output space
- wraps text to fit within the available margins
- justifies text on left margin but not on right

Line breaks can be forced on wrapping process by the <br> element.

HTML supports two types of container elements

- block-level star ts on newline and holds block-level and inline elements
examples include `<body>`, `<div>`, `<form>`, `<p>`, `<table>`
- inline can only contain data and other inline elements
examples include `<a>`, `<b>`, `<code>`, `<img>`, `<q>`, `<span>`

`<div>` and `<span>` are general grouping elements that self-nest.

Paragraph tags `<p>` are block-level elements that don’t self-nest.

## Hypertext
Hyper links and anchors for links are specified as follows:
```
<a href="URL">...</a> clickable hyper link to another page
<... id="anchor"> identifies tag of any type inside page
<a href="URL#anchor">...</a> link to anchor inside another page
```

HTML supports hyper linking round text, images and inline markup:
```
<a href="4.xhtml">Links</a> can be attached to text anchor,
link image <a href="6.xhtml"><img src="next.gif" alt="icon"></a>
and <a href="9.xhtml#icon">target</a> element inside a page.
```

# Lists

HTML supports 3 kinds of lists
- definition `<dl> ... </dl>`
- ordered `<ol> ... </ol>`
- unordered `<ul> ... </ul>`

Definition lists are composed of definition titles and data:
```
<dl>
<dt>Volume 1</dt>
<dd>The Fellowship of the Ring</dd>
<dt>Volume 2</dt>
<dd>The Two Towers</dd>
<dt>Volume 3</dt>
<dd>The Return of the King</dd>
</dl>
```

Ordered list itemises its contents with numer ical prefixes:
```
<ol>
<li>Mercury</li>
<li>Venus</li>
<li>Earth</li>
</ol>
```

Deprecated `<ol>` attribute type can be "1", "a", "A", "i" or "I".

Unordered list itemises with bullet point prefixes:
```
<ul>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Wealth</li>
<li>Happiness</li>
</ul>
```

Deprecated `<ul>` attribute type can be "disc", "circle" or "square".

Approved way to customise lists is by alter ing list style attributes.



# eXtensible Markup Language
eXtensible Markup Language is meta language to structure text data.

XML in contrast to HTML was designed to
- be extensible - tags, attr ibutes and values can be defined by users
- suppor t rich str ucture - letting complex data be represented
- require validation or at least well-for medness

XML parsers always reject documents with any bad syntax in them.

XML is simpler but as useful as its meta language precursor SGML.

XML documents consist of:

- declaration definition of object types and attributes, plus
values of named entities in document DTD
- element instance of object, attribute or related value
as defined by DTD that appears in XML body
- comment explanator y text and data ignored by XML parser
character reference definition of notation used to denote text and
other symbols in document given by character sets
- processing instruction directive for related apps e.g. stylesheet
- CDATA section raw character data to be ignored

XML tags
- are case and order sensitive
- come in nested pairs or are marked as standalone
- have exactly one top level or root element
- quote all attribute values




# XML Examples

Simple XML example with declaration which must be first if present:
```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<person born="1912-06-23" died="1954-06-07">
<name> <first>Alan</first> <family>Turing</family> </name>
<profession>computer scientist</profession>
</person>
```

More complicated example with (non-existent) DTD specified:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE titlepage SYSTEM "http://www.id.org/dtd/hi.dtd"
[<!ENTITY rights "GNU General Public License GPLv3">]>
<?xml-stylesheet version="1.0" type="text/xsl" href="style.xsl"?>
<titlepage>
<!-- This is a comment! -->
<title font="Baskerville" size="24/30" alignment="centered">
&quot; Munde Salutem &quot; </title>
<white-space type="vertical" amount="12"/> &rights;
<image location="http://www.foo.bar/fleuron.eps"
type="URL" alignment="centered"/>
<![CDATA[ bad XML tag example: <2-faced name=Jason> ]]>
</titlepage>
```

XML supports modular isation of names via namespaces to
- distinguish elements and attributes from different tag sets
- group related elements and attributes together

Namespace example qualifies name with prefix and links it to URI:
```
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">
<rdf:Description rdf:about="index.htm">
<dc:title> Web Programming Lectures </dc:title>
<dc:creator> John Jones </dc:creator>
</rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>
```

Default namespace example gives it to svg, ellipse, rect tags:
```
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
width="12cm" height="10cm">
<ellipse rx="110" ry="130" />
<rect x="4cm" y="1cm" width="3cm" height="6cm" />
</svg>
```


# XML Syntax Errors

Example of several XML errors
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<item type=mango>
<price> 6 euros </Price>
<Description> nice
<weight> 127 grammes
</Description> </weight>
</item>
<item type="pear" quality="good" type="pear">
<price> 2.53 euros
</item>
```

One way of correcting these errors:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<basket>
<item type="mango">
<price> 6 euros </price>
<Description> nice </Description>
<weight> 127 grammes </weight>
</item>
<item type="pear" quality="good">
<price> 2.53 euros </price>
</item>
</basket>
```

Corrections
- introduce <basket> element to get sole root element
- put quotes round value of type attr ibute in <item>
- coerce </Pr ice> tag to lower case
- reorder </Descr iption> and </weight> tags
_ add </pr ice> tag to close child of last <item> tag
- remove repeated type attr ibute in last <item> tag

XML parsers always reject bad XML unlike HTML parsers


# XHTML

XHTML is HTML expressed in XML syntax
- employing the "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" namespace
- that is either XHTML 1.0, XHTML 1.1 or XHTML 5+
- using a subset of HTML syntax with optional XML extras

XHTML doesn’t allow valid HTML expressions like

- `<I>Keyser Soze</i>` mismatched tags, XML tags are case sensitive
- `<img src=pic.jpg>` unquoted attribute value
- `<p>Finis<p>` unclosed tags - use `<p>Finis</p>` or `<p/>Finis<p/>`
- `<video autoplay>` valueless attribute - use `<video autoplay="autoplay">`


Polyglot XHTML is HTML and XML at same time with same meaning
- where all element and attribute names are in lower case
- parsed as XML when served as application/xhtml+xml
- parsed as HTML when served as text/html

Examples of non-polyglot XHTML - valid XML but invalid HTML

- `<br></br> <br>` has no end tag in HTML
- `<![CDATA[&]]>` illegal HTML tag and illegal solo &

Strict version of XHTML 1.0 is declared by
```
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
```
XHTML is best written by declar ing namespace in root element.
```
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
```

Add validation links to XHTML pages to aid compliance checking.


# HTML 5

Up to 2009 W3C aimed to evolve modular XHTML from 1.1 into 2.0.

Web Hyper text Application Technology Wor king Group

- was founded in 2004 to revive interest in HTML
- was led by dev elopers from Apple, Mozilla, Opera Software
- was unhappy about W3C shift to XHTML and then XML

In 2009 W3C agreed to wor k instead with WHATWG on HTML 5.

Objectives for new version of HTML were to
- base new features on HTML, CSS, DOM and JavaScr ipt
- provide more markup to replace scripting
- reduce need for exter nal plugins
- achieve more device independence
- handle errors better in for ms and elsewhere

HTML 5 has 3 representations - HTML, XHTML, in memory DOM.

Recommended template for HTML 5 page is its XHTML serialisation:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8" />
<title> ... </title>
</head>
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
```

XHTML with ".html" or ".htm" suffix is served as text/html.

XHTML with ".xhtml" suffix is served as application/xhtml+xml.

Browsers use XML parser to read latter. Errors stop page loading.



# Accessing Web Pages

Browsers fetch HTML pages from local file system or a web server.

Local file system includes files
- on file systems expor ted to local PC - H:\page.html
- on file systems on Unix host - /home/cs2/bozo/page.html

These files are referenced by the following URLs

- file:///H:/page.html on Windows host
- file:///home/cs2/bozo/page.html on Unix host

HTML pages fetched from a web server via HTTP
- name a web server to fetch from - http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk
- specify a path and file name - /cs/online/wp/index.xhtml
- are fetched from path relative to web server’s root directory

Different web servers may have different root directories:
- http://www2.macs.hw.ac.uk/index.html/var/www/html on anubis
- http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/index.htm/home/www on athena

If path mentions a user such as bob
- using URL such as http://www2.macs.hw.ac.uk/bob/page.htm
- path is relative to web directory under his home directory

Web servers may use different names for these web directories:

- http://www2.macs.hw.ac.uk/bob/page.htm bob/public_html/page.htm
- http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/smith/page.htm smith/www/page.htm

# Key HTML Points
- HyperText Markup Language is a readable document for matting
  language that supports hyper linking, presentational markup for
  text, images, lists, tables, for ms, embedded objects and AV
  media, as well as scripting and stylesheets.
- HTML is designed to support scrollable, reflowable presentation
  of text and other for matted content that adjusts its use of the
  layout to the available width without requiring lateral scrolling.
- XML is a markup language like HTML but with a simpler and
  more rigorous syntax that defines the structure of a textual
  document so it can be presented, semantically checked,
  transfor med or filtered by programs as well as read by people.
- XHTML is HTML expressed in XML syntax enabling XHTML
  documents to offer the greater simplicity of XML markup, the
  rigor and processability of XML, and the presentational
  proper ties of HTML.



# Adding Style With CSS

Cascading Style Sheets or CSS is being revised as CSS 2 version 2.

CSS directives specify how to present HTML and XML with pattern
```
selector { property: value; ...; property: value }
```
They gover n presentation on screen or in print and can be given in
- link statement in head section of HTML page
- `<style>` tags in HTML page
- style attr ibute of any HTML tag

Style directives in file URI can be declared in HTML head section
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
```

Style directives for HTML can also be embedded in a page
```
<style>
p {
line-height: 200%;
hyphens: none
}
h1 { font-weight: bolder; }
</style>
```

A style attribute can also be attached to any HTML tag
```
<h3 style="width: 50%; font-style: normal">Conclusion</h3>
```

Style can also be declared by impor t directives in CSS.
```
color: red;
@import url("http://style.com/newlook.css");
@import "http://style.com/default.css";
```

Stylesheet directives are given in XML via processing instructions
```
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/css" href="style.css"?>
```

Internal override exter nal directives. Later override earlier.
This is why style sheets in CSS are said to cascade.


# Selectively Applying CSS


All HTML elements can be given one or both of the attributes
- class value is shared identifier of one or more elements
- id value is unique identifier of that element

CSS selector syntax supports their exploitation:
- tag.identifier selects all elements of name tag of class identifier
- tag#identifier selects element tag whose id is identifier


Style declaration in CSS
```
p.blue { color: blue; font-size: smaller; text-align: center }
p.emph { color: red; font-style: italic }
h4#garish { color: fuchsia; font-family: fantasy; margin-left: 5% }
```
can be applied to HTML markup
```
<p class="emph"> Business is growing. </p>
<p class="blue"> Household debt is increasing. </p>
<p class="emph"> House prices are rising. </p>
<h4 id="garish"> Inflation is looming! </h4>
```
to apply shared styles to some elements and unique style to another.
CSS2 selectors include the following patterns:

- * matches any element
- E matches any element E
- E>F matches any element F that is child of E
- E+F matches any element F immediately preceded by E
- E[foo] matches any element E with attribute foo set to any value
- E[foo="pah"] matches any element E with attribute foo set to "pah"
- E:link matches any unvisited hyper link



# Styling Text Blocks

Style directives in CSS
```
main#content {
position: absolute;
left: 12em
}
nav.links {
background-color: #ff99cc;
margin-left: 2em;
padding: 1em;
width: 4em
}
```

can be applied to HTML markup
```
<div style="position: relative">
<main id="content">
<h4>Internet Marketplaces</h4>
<p>Top online marketplaces include e-Bay, Amazon,
Craigslist and Alibaba.</p>
</main>
<nav class="links">
<a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a> <br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> <br>
<a href="http://www.craigslist.com">Craigslist</a> <br>
<a href="http://www.alibaba.com">Alibaba</a>
</nav>
</div>
```

to split markup into a part for navigation and part for content.
Add CSS validation link to any HTTP loaded (X)HTML page with
```
<a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer">CSS</a>
```

CSS validator can also be used via URI, file upload or cut and paste.


# CSS 2.1

CSS 2.1 is latest full-spectr um standard and
-  defines more than 90 properties
-  allows vendor properties such as -moz-border-radius

All current CSS standards (2 and 3) are given in 2017 snapshot.

CSS 2.1 uses var ious size measures and %s of inherited values

- em font-size of relevant font
- ex height of x character in relevant font
- in inches - 2.54 centimetres is 1in
- cm centimetres
- pt points - 1/72 of an inch
- pc picas - 1 pc is equal to 12pt
- px pixel units - 1px is equal to 0.75pt


Colour words include 17 original and more in CSS 3 color module
- aqua black blue fuchsia gray green
- lime maroon navy olive orange purple
- red silver teal white yellow


Use a Colour Map to specify other hues by RGB values:
- rgb(x, y, z) x, y and z are integer values between 0 and 255
- rgb(x, y, z) x, y and z are percentages between 0% and 100%
- #RrGgBb R, r, G, g, B, b are hexadecimals in range 0 .. 9, A .. F

Same colour is specified by each of

- rgb(128, 128, 0) rgb(50%, 50%, 0%) #808000 yellow




# CSS Box Layout

CSS 2.1 defines 4 layout modes
- block for documents
- inline for text
- positioned for explicit positioning
- table for 2D data in tabular for mat


CSS 2.1 box model is based on content surrounded by its context.

Properties can be set for all these surrounds:
```
<style>
.out { border: thick dashed red;
width: 15em;
margin-left: 3em }
.in { border: thin dotted blue;
padding: 12px 6px 4px 2px;
margin: 2px 4px 6px 12px }
</style>
<div class="out">
<div class="in"> The truth is rarely pure and never simple. </div>
</div>
```

Borders can be set via
- border-style none, dotted, dashed, solid, ridge etc.
- border-... e.g. border-top for top, right, bottom, left
- border sets border-width, border-style, border-color


# CSS and Tables


Box model replaces table attributes - border, cellpadding, cellspacing.

CSS property border-collapse has 2 models for table borders
- collapse borders are merged and cell groups can have borders
  border conflicts resolve towards hidden, thick, solid
- separate default model, only cells and table have borders not rows etc
  border-spacing gives distance among cell borders

Consider a table
```
<table id="t1">
<colgroup> <col id="col1"/> <col/> <col/> </colgroup>
<tr>
<td class="c1">Sunday</td> <td>red top</td> <td>Sunday Post</td>
</tr>
<tr id="row2">
<td class="c1">Daily</td> <td>broadsheet</td> <td>The Times</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="c1">Daily</td> <td>red top</td> <td>The Sun</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="c1">Sunday</td> <td>broadsheet</td> <td>Sunday Times</td>
</tr>
</table>
```

It can be styled by collapsed border model with
```
table#t1 { border-collapse: collapse }
td { padding: 6px;
border: thin solid blue }
col#col1 { border: thick solid red }
tr#row2 { border: thick solid green }
```

or styled by separated border model with

```
table#t1 { border-collapse: separate;
border-spacing: 3px }
td { padding: 6px;
border: thin solid blue }
td.c1 { border: thick solid red }
tr#row2 td { border: thick solid green }
```

# CSS 3 and Multi-Columns


CSS 3 is being developed as modules that include:
| CSS | Details |
|:--  |:--      |
|2D/3D transfor ms transfor mations on shape, size, position and 3D
  rotations|
|animations keyframe animations|
|backgrounds/borders resizing background, background image locus,
  rounded borders, boxes with shadows|
|flexible box model box model generalized to apply to ver tical text,
  properties to control marquee effect (speed, direction)|
|multi-columns column count, column gap and rules between columns|
|text effects text with shadows, word wrapping
  transitions changes to CSS properties overatime period|
|user interface resizing elements, sizing boxes, offsetting outlines|

## Columns

Multi-columns are specified by CSS 3 column proper ties:
- column-count number of columns
- column-gap width between columns
- column-r ule specifies color, style and width of the rule

3 columns with green rules is produced by the CSS 3 markup
```
<style>
div#ex1 {
column-count: 3;
column-gap: 30px;
column-rule: 3px outset green
}
</style>
<div id="ex1">
<p> ... </p>
</div>
```


# CSS 3 and Text Effects

CSS 3 supports underlines, text shadows and emphasis marks.

These text decoration properties include:
- text-decoration values for line, style and color
- text-decoration-line none, under line, overline, line-through
- text-decoration-style solid, double, dotted, dashed, wavy
- text-shadow h-shadow v-shadow blur-distance color

Example style directives include

- text-decoration: overline wavy green
- text-decoration: underline solid red
- text-shadow: 5px 5px 2px gray

Some text effects may not be supported by your browser.

CSS 3 users can now load their own WOFF, TTF and OTF fonts:
```
<style>
@font-face {
font-family: myScript;
src: url(freebooterscript.woff)
}
p.freebooter {
font-family: myScript;
margin-left: 3em;
font-size: xx-large
}
</style>
<p class="freebooter"> Hoist the Skull and Crossbones. </p>
```


# CSS 3 and Backgrounds

CSS 3 supports flexible for matting of images in background.

These new CSS3 style properties include:
- background-image URL of source
- background-position direction percentage length
- background-size height width
- background-repeat repeat round space no-repeat
- background image position size repeat origin clip

Values of these properties can be supplied in var ious ways.

Repeating background is achieved by
```
<style>
div.caption {
background: url(water.jpg) repeat;
width: 20em;
padding: 1em 4em;
color: white;
font-size: x-large;
font-weight: bold;
margin-left: 3em
}
</style>
<div class="caption"> Darkness was upon the face of the deep. </div>
```

HWU logo could be put into fixed background position with:
```
<style>
body {
background-image: url(hwlogo.png);
background-attachment: fixed;
background-position: right top;
background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
</style>
```

Fixed content doesn’t move when a web page scrolls


# CSS 3 and Borders

CSS 3 supports rounded corners, shadows, and border images:
- border-radius radius of curvature for corner
- box-shadow h-shadow v-shadow blur spread color
- border-image source slice width outset repeat

A box with rounded corners is achieved by
```
<style>
.round {
border-radius: 20%;
border: 3px dotted blue;
padding: 18px;
width: 110px;
height: 18px;
}
</style>
<p class="round" style="width: 110px"> Let there be light. </p>
```

Border-radius of 50% with same height and width produces a circle.

Box shadows are given in much the same way as text shadows:
```
<style>
div.rectangle {
box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px 2px black;
width: 15em;
padding: 12px;
background-color: #CCCCFF;
}
</style>
<div class="rectangle">Am I dying, or is this my birthday?</div>
```

Spread parameter controls expansion or contraction of shadow shape.

Border-image uses inward slices from 4 image sides to define border
```
<style>
#vines {
border: 40px solid transparent;
padding: 15px;
width: 160px;
border-image: url(vines.jpg) 155 170 repeat;
}
</style>
<p id="vines">La belle dame sans merci.</p>
```

# CSS 3 and Transforms

CSS 3 supports 2D and 3D transfor mation proper ties
- transfor m list of transfor mation functions
- transfor m-origin move origin to X, Y

Origin is initially set to middle of content’s bounding box i.e.
- transform-origin: 50% 50%

Transfor mation functions include:
- translate(X, Y) 2D translation in X and Y directions
- scale(N, M) 2D resizing byNhor izontally and M ver tically
- rotate(A) 2D rotation clockwise about origin through angle A
- skew(X, Y) rotation about X and Y axes
- rotateX(N) 3D rotation about X axis
- rotateY(N) 3D rotation about Y axis

Box is spun about its centre by
```
<style>
div#box {
background-color: aqua;
border: 1px solid red
height: 2em;
width: 7em;
transform: translate(12em, 0em) rotate(0deg);
}
</style>
<div id="box"> </div>
<script type="text/javascript">
function spin(n) {
var el = document.getElementById("box");
el.style.transform = "translate(12em, 0em) rotate(" + n + "deg)";
n=n+1;
window.setTimeout("spin("+ n + ")", 30);
}
spin(0);
</script>
```

JavaScript updates its rotation by 1degree every 30 msec.


# CSS 3 and Animations


CSS 3 animations can dynamically alter any CSS properties.

Animations are enumerated via keyframes and changes smoothed.

In this animation a green ball bounces forever:
```
<style>
#ball {
width: 100px;
height: 100px;
position: relative;
background: green;
border: 4px solid black;
border-radius: 50%;
animation: bounce 5s linear infinite;
}
@keyframes bounce {
from { left: 250px; top:-100px; }
25% { left: 0px; top: 150px; }
50% { left: 250px; top: 400px; }
75% { left: 500px; top: 150px; }
to { left: 250px; top:-100px; }
}
</style>
<div id="ball"></div>
```

animation property encapsulates several proper ties including
- animation-name: bounce;
- animation-duration: 5s;
- animation-timing-function: linear;
- animation-iteration-count: infinite;

Change timing function to its default value "ease" and duration to 3s.


# CSS 3 and Transitions

CSS 3 transitions apply property changes smoothly overaper iod.
Transitions can create dynamic effects such as a spinning black hole.

Image rotates and its border alters when hovered over:
```
<style>
#morph {
border: 1px dotted red;
width: 240px;
height: 240px;
transition: all 1s linear 1s;
}
#morph:hover {
border: 40px solid black;
transform: rotate(360deg) scale(5, 5);
}
</style>
<div id="morph">
<img src="blackhole.png" alt="black hole" style="width: 240px"/>
</div>
```

CSS 3 transfor m is used to rotate the black hole.
- transition proper ty encapsulates several proper ties including
- transition-property: all;
- transition-duration: 1s;
- transition-timing-function: linear;
- transition-delay: 1s;

Change timing function to ease, duration to 3s and delay to 3s.

# CSS Key Points

- CSS directives specify how to present markup. They are given in
  files, inline within style tags or in style attributes. Introducing
  CSS rather than adding more attributes to HTML is a simpler
  and more generic way to specify presentation in a wider set of
  styles.
- CSS is collected from var ious sources and reconciled for
  consistency by favour ing the inner over the outer and the later
  over the earlier. The CSS 2.1 standard defines more than 90
  proper ties which are applied to HTML markup using CSS
  selectors.
- CSS 3 is being developed as modules addressing issues like
  multi-columns, text effects, backgrounds, borders, transfor ms,
  transitions and animations.
