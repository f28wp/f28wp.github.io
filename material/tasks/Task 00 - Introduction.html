# Lab - Introduction 

Lab exercises to help you master the subject material and to complement the lecture material for Web Programming (F28WP).

## Overview

* Every week has a set of exercises/labs for you to work on 
* Each exercise will help you with your courseworks/revision 
* Do not worry if you are unable to finish the exercises, but attempt all the exercises


# 1.0 GitHub

## Tasks:
Work through the various exercises for GitHub to familiarize yourself with working with GitHub (e.g., understanding essentials of version control, hello world, forking, creating readme for repository, tracking statistics for a repository).

  *	https://guides.github.com

  *	Essential abilities include:
    * Create, clone and update a repository on GitHub
    * Clone the repository locally on different machines
    * Work with others on shared files (e.g., handle file change conflicts/out of date repositories)
  *	Work with friends to familiarize yourself with working with others
  *	Try cloning a different public repository from GitHub (e.g., https://github.com/nodejs/node)
  *	Look at the GitHub statistics for your and other repositories on GitHub (e.g., number of commits, which lines changed, how often, …)


# 2.0 Team Work

Essential you’re comfortable with GitHub and able to work with others as the coursework requires you to manage a complex web programming project as a team (i.e., 3-5 people).

Think about who you want to work with – as next week you’ll need to let the lecturer know who your teams and the details for your project (e.g., repository names, usernames, aims/goals, plan, ..). 

# 3.0 University Domain (http://www2.macs.hw.ac.uk/~studentID/index.html)

Check you’re able to access your ‘H’ drive, which should have a ‘public_html’ folder.  This folder is mapped to ‘www2.macs.hw.ac.uk/~studentID’.  Create a test html file (e.g., index.html) and add it to your public folder to ensure you’re able to see your file in the web browser.

You can use this folder as a means to test out examples and resources in future labs, including your coursework.

# Online Editors/Tools 

Take a look at some of the online Web-based editors for developing your software:

* jsfiddle.net
* jsbin.com 
* codepen.io

Try creating a simple project, such as, a simple html page with one of the online web-based tools.


# MACS Virtual Machine

There are multiple free online web-based resources to test out concepts.

However, there is the MACS Linux VM, where the `hw` user has sudo/root
permissions:

* https://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/VM/

This might be overkill, especially for some test cases (e.g., you might only need a web-browser and a text editor) - however, the resource is there if you need it.

# Key Server

Keyserver allows students to get remote access to the PCs in the University Computing labs (including the processing power and access to the software) from home.

Link to Keyserver:
* https://keyserver.hw.ac.uk/maps

# X2GO (Linux)

Access the Linux lab machines through ssh or x2go.

Details are available here:
* https://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/cs/faq.html
