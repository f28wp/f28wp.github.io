If you look at the various tools and technologies around on web development, you'll find the answer is not so simple.
No single web programming tool or language does everything.
Hence, you have to be proficient in a variety of web technologies.
For example, if you're developing a server-client system you need to understand database technologies, security provisions and more.

As you must be aware.
Since the material is all on GitHub it should be easy for you to access everything easily.
[pause]
The slides are interactive, so you can work through them and try out examples.
Also there are activities, such as, quizzes and puzzles to work through and various web-based game demos for you to look at and go through the code to help you with your coursework.
[pause]
You have access to all the material in one place (easy to navigate layout).
All the interactive lecture slides.

<aside class='notes'>
As you should be aware, from the title of the course.
You will need to do some programming.
Hence, you should get into the habit of regularly reading and trying to understand what code does.
[pause]
For example, the following short snippet shows a Javascript program.
You will do lots of JavaScript programming in this course.
You'll learn about numbers and not-a-number (NANs).
[pause].
In the example, the second alert will trigger as NANs are special and fail equality checks - even when you check them against themselves.
