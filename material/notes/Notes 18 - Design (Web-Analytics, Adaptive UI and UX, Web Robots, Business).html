# Notes - Design

Supplementary notes to complement the lecture material for web programming (F28WP).

# Scripting Languages
Originally a scripting language or script language was a programming language to write
programs that can interpret and automate the execution of other applications. Web
pages within a web browser are a good case of applications that can be automated
through scripting.


> In web development, scripts are computer programs that allow web pages
to be interactive and dynamic based on user input. Scripts can be
categorised as either client-side or server-side, depending on where they
are executed. 

A scripting language was designed to glue together other applications and tools. Thus,
you can reuse existing applications to create your own application or, you can get
existing applications to act the way you want; e.g. Using JavaScript you can change
the behaviour of browsers.
Typically, a scripting language is characterised by the following properties:
- Ease of use:
  Scripting languages are intended to be very fast to pick up and author programs
  in. This generally implies relatively simple syntax and semantics.
- Database and file-system facilities:
  Scripting is built in with easy interfaces to use databases and the file system.
- Interpreted from source code:
  To give the fastest turnaround from script to execution; so scripts can be written
  and executed without explicit compile and link steps.
- Relatively loose structure:
  It would be difficult to use Java as a scripting language due to the rules about
  which classes exist in which files - contrast to Python, where it's possible to
  simply define some functions in a file.

In truth, the term scripting language is a somewhat awkward one now because many
of the modern scripting languages have outgrown the group's scripting origins and are
now standalone general-purpose programming languages of considerable power (e.g.
Phyton). We continue using it because nobody has yet invented a better term.

> A Software Engineer specialised in Web Programming should be
comfortable mixing various scripting and general-purpose languages within
large web-based applications. What makes scripting languages stand out from general-purpose programming languages is that they have a runtime to do interpretation and to automate dynamic storage management.


# Web Scripting “Rules”
- Rule of Modularity: Write simple scripts connected by clean interfaces.
- Rule of Clarity: Clarity is better than cleverness. Rewrite any confusing code.
- Rule of Composition: Design programs to be connected with other programs.
- Rule of Separation: Separate design from functionality; separate user interfaces
from data source engines.
- Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must.
- Rule of Minimum Size: Keep programs very small and manageable. Write a big
program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.
- Rule of Transparency: Program for visibility to make inspection and debugging
easier (not only indentations).
- Rule of Robustness: Robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity.
- Rule of Representation: Fold knowledge into data, so program logic can be stupid
and robust. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.
- Rule of Least Surprise: In interface design, always do the least surprising thing. +
means plus (add) OK?
- Rule of Repair: Cope nicely with errors that you can detect - but when you must
fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible.
- Rule of Economy: Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to
machine time. Automated as much as you can.
- Rule of Production-first: Avoid hand-hacking programmes that are in production;
use a development server instead.
- Rule of Testing: Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it.
Your best friend is your end user.
- Rule of Optimization: Distrust all claims for one true way
- Rule of Extensibility: Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you
think.
- Rule of Universality: Always create accessible web content for everyone

(Adapted from "The Art of Unix Programming" by Eric Steven Raymond) 




In other words:

- Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
- Write programs to work together.
- Write programs that can be read by humans.
- Be tough in what you accept, and correct in what you give
- Reap the benefits of collaborative development
- Apply defensive programming techniques to reduce and flush out errors
- Resolve critical construction issues early and correctly
- Build quality into the beginning, middle, and end of your project
- Think in maintenance. It’s harder to read code than to write it. 


# Client-side and server-side scripting languages

There isn’t a clear line drawn between client-side and server-side scripting languages.
The main distinction between the two is the where about the execution of the code
takes place. Some other distinctions include that server-side scripting gives more
control (security) and it is more powerful programmability than client-side scripting.
Server-side scripts are hidden (the user will only be able to see the HTML output even
if they attempt to get access to the source.) It is important to know to choose between
using client or server-side scripting when developing web applications. You are also
be expected to use them simultaneously. 


Client-side scripts are executed on the users’ device (e.g. web browser.) They allow
for the creation of faster and more responsive web applications. JavaScript is the most
popular client-side scripting languages. These scripts can be embedded (when the
script is written directly within HTML code, contained between `<script>` and `</script>`
tags) or external (when the script is in separated file that is called by the HTML using
the filename provided in the src attribute of the `<script>` tag.) JavaScript (JS) can be
used to develop complex problems. Thus, JS uses patterns, objectoriented (OO)
coding, AJAX, etc. Advanced JS developers have created JavaScript libraries, which
are pre-written JavaScript code to enable easier development of JavaScript-based
applications (e.g. AngularJs, ExpressJs, etc.) The most popular JS library is probably
jQuery. One popular scripting language in the iOS environment is Objective-C, which
is widely used to develop mobile apps. To execute, the scripting language needs to be
enabled on the client computer. 


Server-side scripts are code that is executed (interpreted) on the web server, before
the web page is sent to the browser, in response to requests received from a clientside application (e.g. web browser). The purpose of server side scripts is to implement
the business logic of web applications, by processing user inputs, updating databases
and data sources and, interacting with other applications residing on the server. There
are various server-side scripting languages. The decision of choosing a server-side
language should be based on the security, architecture, scalability, performance and
functional requirements of the problem as well as using web programming best practices. By comparison, syntax is the less important part. However, it is advisable to
have same level of expertise in the most demanded scripting languages such as
Python, PHP and Ruby.


Some big changes to web application architecture since 3-tier includes:

Web Service Oriented Architecture, in which a lot of the code for the full web
application exists as services, each with its own Web API. So when service a website,
one part of the full web application (one web API) can make a request to another part
of the code (a second API), often running on a different web server or on the cloud.
The APIs are frequently organised according to REST design principles. The request
and the response are typically just data, not necessarily human-friendly
representations.

Single-page application, in which important part of the web application functionality
is provided by a rich JavaScript code; which stays in the user's browser over many
user interactions. The UI can perform many asynchronous or synchronous requests to
the web server without reloading the webpage. It uses AJAX or WebSockets for this
communication. This gives the user a smoother more natural experience, without being
interrupted by page loads.

Together these two trends have enabled web apps to be designed for multiple
platforms. This is important in the modern world when many users are on tablets or
smartphones devices, instead of full-screen browsers on laptops or desktop
computers. These technologies, together with RWD and AWD techniques, enable the
design of websites that can fit smaller screens, even while most of the code for the full
web application remains the same.

Furthermore, the above two trends have motivated and at the same time, been
favoured by the development of modern front-end and back-end development
frameworks, such as Angular, React, Redux, Flux, Ruby on Rails, Django , Node.js
with express and, many more. 



## Definition of N-Tier Architecture

N-tier architecture is also called multi-tier architecture because the software is
engineered to have the processing, data management, and presentation functions
physically and logically separated. That means that these different functions are hosted on several machines or clusters, ensuring that services are provided without
resources being shared and, as such, these services are delivered at top capacity.
The “N” in the name n-tier architecture refers to any number from one.
Not only does your software gain from being able to get services at the best possible
rate, but also it is also easier to manage. This is because when you work on one
section, the changes you make will not affect the other functions. Moreover, if there is
a problem, you can easily pinpoint where it originates. Multi-tier architecture enables
the management of high volume of data transactions from different database systems. 


## Cloud Computing Terminology

A Fabric Module is bus network system that allows a Cloud System to scale, as your
bandwidth needs increase because each fabric module added increases the total
amount of throughput of the overall system.

The Server Module is the CPU of the cloud system. It is a farm of virtual servers (VMs)
sharing resources of physical servers.

The Storage Module provides data storage for the cloud computer. It comprises the
SAN (Storage-Area-Network) and the storage subsystem that connects storage
devices.
