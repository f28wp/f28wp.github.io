<aside class='notes'>
Let's start by asking [pause]
What do we actually mean by productive web programming?
</aside>
					</textarea>
				</section>
				
				<section data-markdown style="text-align: left;">
					<textarea data-template>
						## What do we mean by Productive Web Programming?
						
						* Structure
						* Reusability
						* Robustness
						* Scalability
						* ..
<aside class='notes'>
When we say productive, we mean a solution that has [pause]
structure [pause]
robust [pause]
scalable [pause]
and more
</aside>
					</textarea>
				</section>
				
				
				<section data-markdown style="text-align: left;">
					<textarea data-template>
						## Why is structure important?
						
						* So we understand how everything **fits together**
						* Bigger picture
						* Logical and **reliable**
						* **Client-server** interaction
						* What goes where and why (e.g., client or server)
<aside class='notes'>
Structure is important as it helps us understand how everything fits together [pause]
Also makes it easier for us to manage large and complex projects [pause]
It helps us separate and modularize the problem [pause]
That is, what goes where and why.
Which is important for client server archtiectures.
</aside>

				<section data-background="images/lec14-01.png" data-background-size="contain">
<aside class='notes'>
This leads us to the Three-their Architecture [pause]
Which splits the client server interaction and connection into three components [pause]
Client side which represents the front-end application [pause]
while the server side is made up of the back-end software and data base.
</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background="images/lec14-02.png" data-background-size="contain">
<aside class='notes'>
The interaction between layers is shown in the figure [pause]
With the client using scripts to relay information to the server which then accesses the database.
</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background="images/lec14-03.png" data-background-size="contain">
<aside class='notes'>
The client side is designed to run scripts on the user's machine.
For example, javascript.
[pause]
The server side runs scripts designed for the server and cannot be seen by the user's.
For example, the reading and writing to the database is done using scripts on the server.
The client cannot directly access the database.
</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background="images/lec14-04.png" data-background-size="contain">
<aside class='notes'>
You can think of scripting languages as the glue that holds everything together.
[pause]
Without the scripts the client and server applications would be static.
[pause]
That is they would not be interactive and dynamic.
[pause]
Also you should understand that a script is different from a compiled program.
Scripts are interpreted directly. while compiled source code is compiled direclty to machine language for the machine it will run on. Will not run on other platforms.
</aside>

				<section data-background="images/lec14-05.png" data-background-size="contain">
<aside class='notes'>
Web scripting can get messy [pause]
What the user sees is often not what is happening underneath.
[pause]
Don't get into the bad habit of writing and hiding messy unmanageable scripts.
[pause]
Becomes an issue when you need to fix a bug and a new feature.

				<h1>Web Scripting Good Practices</h1>
<aside class='notes'>
So what are some web scripting good practices?
</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background="images/lec14-06.png" data-background-size="contain">
<aside class='notes'>
Think maintenance [pause]
It's harder to read code than to write it 
[pause]
</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background="images/lec14-07.png" data-background-size="contain">
<aside class='notes'>
For example, make your code readable [pause]
Use indentation.
</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background="images/lec14-08.png" data-background-size="contain">
<aside class='notes'>
Write helpful comments [pause]
Don't just comment randomly.
[pause]
</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background="images/lec14-09.png" data-background-size="contain">
<aside class='notes'>
A good folder structure is always important [pause]
Not to mention, file names [pause]
Don't just throw all your files into one folder [pause]
[pause]
</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background="images/lec14-10.png" data-background-size="contain">
<aside class='notes'>
Naming consistency [pause]
Don't change your naming style constantly [pause]
For example, underscores or camel case naming convention [pause]
Use one or another 
[pause]
</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background="images/lec14-11.png" data-background-size="contain">
<aside class='notes'>
Group libraries together [pause]
separate client and server scripts [pause]
Use a hierarchy if necessary [pause]

</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background="images/lec14-12.png" data-background-size="contain">
<aside class='notes'>
Small robust scripts that are easy to test and validate is better than lots of large scripts that do everything.
[pause]
Don't cut corners by having scripts bypass safety checks.
[pause]
For example, if you have a database manager to track and manage database reads and writes. [pause]
Avoid accessing the database directly and avoiding the manager.
</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background="images/lec14-13.png" data-background-size="contain">
<aside class='notes'>
Use object orientated programming tactics

</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background="images/lec14-14.png" data-background-size="contain">

Avoid reinventing the wheel
[pause]
If global variables and pre existing functions exist, use them.
[pause]
Don't create your own just because you're too lazy.
[pause]
Helps make the code more readable and robust.
[pause]
Since it will use a consistent set of global variables and functions. 
</aside>

				<section data-background="images/lec14-15.png" data-background-size="contain">

Feature creep
[pause]
Starts off as nice tidy function but ends up doing lots of things 
[pause]
Difficult to manage, test and integrate into a system 
[pause]
Also have lots of overhead and redundancy.
</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background="images/lec14-17.png" data-background-size="contain">
<aside class='notes'>
Think about the future [pause]
